# (Better) TTR Launcher

## Description
A alternate Windows launcher for Toontown Rewritten, written in Python/PyQt. Currently, it's aiming to catch up with the features of the Mac launcher. 

If you want to test it out, get PyQt [(x86)][1] [(x64)][2], then run:
```
python main.py
```

## Current Features
* Take user's login information, log into game
* Wait in the play queue
* Anti-aliasing on window borders (read: no more jaggies)
* Animated launcher effects: rotating dials, flashing electricity
* Custom text boxes

## Features To Be Implemented
* Downloading new files from game server
* Two-factor auth
* Invasion Tracker with notifications
